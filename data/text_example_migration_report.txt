Net migration to Germany has been declining continuously since 2016. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified this trend. As a result of the global travel restrictions that were caused by the pandemic, the decline in migration was particularly noticeable from March 2020 onwards. In 2020, a total of 1,186,702 arrivals and 966,451 departures were recorded, so that immigration to Germany decreased by 23.9 percent, and emigration fell by 21.5 percent in comparison to 2019. These developments culminated in net migration of +220,251 persons. This was a significantly lower value than in 2019 (+327,060 persons). More or less pronounced declines were therefore also shown in the individual forms of migration.
Migration to and from Germany continues to be especially characterised by arrivals from and departures to other European countries. This meant that 69.1 percent of all immigrants came to Germany from another European country in 2020 (66.4 percent in 2019), 54.6 percent of them from EU Member States (incl. the United Kingdom). The importance of intra-European migration is also reflected in the number of departures: Europe was the main destination region here too. About two-thirds of those emigrating moved from Germany to another European country in 2020 (67.4 percent; 67.2 percent in 2019); 55.7 percent migrated to other EU Member States including the United Kingdom (56.0 percent in 2019).
The number of asylum applications reflects the ongoing decline in forced migration: The number of first-time applications fell from 722,370 to 142,509 in the period 2016 to 2019 (-80.3 per cent). The declining trend continued in 2020 due to the pandemic. 102,581 people applied for asylum for the first time, this being 28.0 percent fewer than in 2019. The number of asylum applicants thus fell below the 2013 level (109,580 first-time applications). 25.9 percent of asylum applicants in 2020 were children under the age of one who were born in Germany (26,520 asylum applications), and their share increased again in comparison to 2019 (22.0 percent). This brought the number of cross-border first-time asylum applications in 2020 to 76,061 (2019: 111,094).
